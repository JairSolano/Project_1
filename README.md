### Project 1
#### By: Hassatou Diallo, Haseen Ayon, Jair Solano

    ![Data of NYC Employees Salary from a sample of 100,000 employees](/sample_nyc_employee_salary_histogram.jpeg)

>We gathered information on the rent for NYC as a way to gauge the cost of living.
>
>Considering that there are a lot of expenses that vary, using the rent of a NYC apartment as a strong
>marker of the percentage of expenses going out monthly.    


>We discovered that in 2023, the highest reported 
>rent was $6,147 and the lowest was $2,084. Leaving 
>the median somewhere in between, coming in at $3,457


>There is also a comparison made to Austin, Texas.
>We compared the *rent* from Austin to that of NYC, 
>to show the difference in growth and overall cost. 

#### __In Conclusion__ 
>We determined that the average salary for a NYC 
>Employee does not keep up with the soaring cost 
>of living in
